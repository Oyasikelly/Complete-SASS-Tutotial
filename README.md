- **Customizable:** Modify variables to create a unique look for your project.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with mobile-first principles.
- **Reusable Mixins:** Powerful and versatile mixins for quick styling.
- **Utility Classes:** Predefined utility classes to speed up development.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
# Using Git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shinobi-library.git
```

### Install via npm
```bash
# Add Shinobi Library as a dependency
npm install shinobi-library
```

### Include in Your Project
1. Import Shinobi Library into your main SASS/SCSS file:
    ```scss
    @import 'path/to/shinobi-library';
    ```

2. Alternatively, include it directly from `node_modules` if installed via npm:
    ```scss
    @import 'node_modules/shinobi-library/shinobi';
    ```

## Getting Started

### Structure
The library is organized into modules to ensure modularity and ease of use:
- **`_variables.scss`**: Contains customizable variables for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
- **`_mixins.scss`**: Reusable mixins for common patterns.
- **`_utilities.scss`**: Utility classes for quick styling.
- **`_components.scss`**: Base styles for commonly used UI components like buttons, cards, etc.

### Example Setup
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Shinobi Library:

#### `_variables.scss`
```scss
// Customize your primary color
$primary-color: #3498db;
$secondary-color: #2ecc71;
$font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
```

#### `main.scss`
```scss
@import 'variables';
@import 'shinobi';

body {
  font-family: $font-family;
  background-color: $secondary-color;
}
```

### Using Mixins
Leverage powerful mixins to simplify your code:

#### Example
```scss
@include flex-center;
```
This centers content both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox.

## Components

### Buttons
Pre-styled button classes for consistency:
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
```

### Cards
A quick card layout:
```html
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="card-title">Shinobi Card</h3>
  <p class="card-content">Minimal and responsive design.</p>
</div>
```

## Customization
Shinobi Library is fully customizable by overriding variables. For example:

```scss
$primary-color: #e74c3c;
$spacing-unit: 1.5rem;
@import 'shinobi';
```
